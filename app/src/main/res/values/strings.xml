	<string name="info_text2">\u0009 This application was originally launched during a development project in the engineering school Telecom Bretagne (now IMT Atlantique). Since then, it became an important project of mine that I slowly developed for about 6 years in my free time. Your feedback and comments are welcome on the Play Store or by email!\n\n\tI hope you will enjoy the game!</string>
	<string name="instru_text">\u0009 You are a hummingbird in a field of menhirs in Brittany and you must gather all the flowers covering the meadow.\n\n\u0009 By swiping your finger in the desired direction, you can fly straight to the next obstacle (menhir, cow or edge). Once stopped, you will be able to fly in another direction.</string> <!-- Menhirs are ancient stones dressed by celtic populations (think Asterix & Obelix !), Brittany is a region in western France. -->
	<string name="instru_text2">\u0009 Along your progression in the Campaign, you will unlock and discover the different elements of the game like the magical flowers, the dynamites, the cows, the cats and the rainbows!</string>
	<string name="instru_text3">\u0009 Start with some Campaign levels, then you could try the Multiplayer Challenges to confront your friends or other players from around the world!\n\n
		\u0009\u0009\u0009\u0009 The Multiplayer mode:\n\n
		\u0009 It is an online competitive mode! For each challenge played, depending on your position in the ranking, you earn (or loose!) a score roughly equivalent to the \"number of defeated players\" minus the \"number of players who defeated you\". In addition, this value is modulated by the general score of the participants in order to valorize weaker participants or newcomers.\n\n
		\u0009 The \"Score\" should therefore be distinguished from the \"Experience\", which is only cumulative and represents the levels you have solved since you play Colibri! The \"Rankings\" page enables you to compare your stats with other participants.\n\n
		Have fun!!
